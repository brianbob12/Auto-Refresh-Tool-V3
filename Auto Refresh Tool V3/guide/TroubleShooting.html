		<h2>unexpected crash or program won't start</h2>
		<p>
		The most likley cause of a crash is corrupted perameters. In order to fix
		this open the program folder and run the resetPerameters python file. After
		this try to re-enter the website information and try again. If the issue
		persists it is likely due to incorect input data such as incorrect URL.
		<br><br>
		This issue could also be cuased by a webpage having no keywords set. This
		can be fixed by going to the webpage section on the cofiguration tool and
		removing NULL keywords. NULL keywords are a red rectangle at the side of the
		screen(as seen below). NULL keywords can be removed by clicking the empty red
		box and adding a valid keyword to the page.
		</p>

		<p>
		An invalid webpage adress is another cuase of a crash. You should test that
		the webpages are valid by following the links on thier areas in the
		configuration tool. If you are unable to follow one of the links, delete
		that webpage by clicking the ,"Remove this webpage" button twice.
		</p>

		<p>
		An unexpected crash could also occur due to mising files. To ceck that all
		files are present, open the program and confirm the presence of the following
		essencial files:
		<ul>
			<li>configuration tool -python file</li>
			<li>curl              - application</li>
			<li>emails            - text document</li>
			<li>keywords          - text document</li>
			<li>main              - python file</li>
			<li>watchList         - text documet</li>
		</ul>
		</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p>
		The crash could possibly be due to a lack of internet connection.
		</p>
		<h2>Reciving Emails Too Ofen</h2>
		<p>
		This issue is caused by the selected keywords changing constantly between
		website loads. The keyword and website at fult can be identified in the
		"keywords:" section of the email. Remove this keyword by navigating to the
		page for that webpage fromt he main menu and clicking on the red box
		containing this keyword.
		</p>
		<h2>Not Reciving Emails When Webpage Is Updated</h2>
		<p>
		This is most likley caused because the keywords are not applicable for this
		specific page or update. To fix this, more keywods should be added.
		</p>
		<h2>Windows prompts with, "how do you what to open this file"</h2>
		<p>
		This is caused by the inncorrect installation of python. Refer to the installation guaide <a href="Installation.html">here</a>.
